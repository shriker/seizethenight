      <p>Looking to help out? Here is how.</p>
<h2 id="something-new">Something New</h2>
<p>The greatest thing you can do to support the spirit of [x] StN [x] is to learn or create something new. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be code, even though many of us were deeply into HTML and CSS due to PetPages. It just has to be <em>something</em>. Bonus points if you can then teach this to someone else.</p>
<ul>
<li>See what resources are available at your local library.</li>
<li>Draw.</li>
<li>Write.</li>
<li><a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a> - The spirit of Geocities. Create your own free website.</li>
<li><a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch.com</a> - Build fast, full-stack web apps in your browser for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">automatetheboringstuff</a> - For complete beginners to (Python) programming.</li>
<li><a href="https://carbon.now.sh/">carbon.now.sh</a> - Create and share beautiful images of your source code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="images-">Images +</h2>
<p>Want to add your artwork to this archive? Email your images with (1) descriptions and (2) how your would like to be attributed to:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:guild@shriker.ca">guild@shriker.ca</a></p>
<p>Depending on the number of images you have, you can either have your own page(s) and/or galleries for each of your characters.</p>
<p>I am also interested in collecting screenshots, writing samples (if you&rsquo;re comfortable), old guild layouts, old usernames and character names, banners, and other bits of graphic design. So if there isn&rsquo;t a category yet, we can create one.</p>
<h2 id="to-this-site">To This Site</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/shriker/seizethenight">source code</a> to this site is publically available for you to look at and contribute to. It is a static site that is being generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It&rsquo;s hosted on GitHub for free.</p>
<h2 id="a-feature-or-suggestion">A Feature or Suggestion</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how to contribute to the code directly? That&rsquo;s okay! You can still <a href="https://github.com/shriker/seizethenight/issues/new/choose">create issues and feature requests</a> without having coding knowledge. ðŸŒ¼</p>
<h2 id="i-wasnt-a-member-but">I wasn&rsquo;t a member, but&hellip;</h2>
<p>If you were not a member of StN, you are still welcome and belong here. There is a pre-customization era creative guild clique that I am aiming this archive at that was far larger than StN. That said, previous membership is not a requirement. You can be a <a href="/join/">member now</a>.</p>
