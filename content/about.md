This is a living archive for the \[x\] Seize the Night \[x\] (StN) guild from Neopets. Circa 2001.

**Seize the Night** (StN) was originally a nameless collective on Neopets. I (soulwolf) started creating threads with the title "\[x\] Lupe Role Play \[x\]" in the "Evil Things and Monster Sightings" neoboard. (There was no Roleplay neoboard category.)

When Neopets introduced guilds, there was enough interest that I decided to create one. I picked the name "Seize the Night" based on the 1998 Dean Koontz novel of the same name.


### Growth

It grew. Fast. In the first couple of months it grew to 260 members. I implemented a council and then a sub-council to help with the influx of people. Then 320 people. 440. 520. It was around this time that the guild became unwieldy.

If you wrote on our guild message board, your message would be gone by the time the page reloaded. You'd drown in the voices.

There was no proper threading. There was no proper moderation. There was no way to implement any sort of escalation path. There wasn't even any visual indication of who was and was not a guild admin. You had to dig deep into the member list or visit individual profiles to figure that out.
