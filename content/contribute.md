Looking to help out? Here is how.

## Something New

The greatest thing you can do to support the spirit of \[x\] StN \[x\] is to learn or create something new. It doesn't have to be code, even though many of us were deeply into HTML and CSS due to PetPages. It just has to be _something_. Bonus points if you can then teach this to someone else.

- See what resources are available at your local library.
- Draw.
- Write.
- [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/) - The spirit of Geocities. Create your own free website.
- [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) - Build fast, full-stack web apps in your browser for free.
- [automatetheboringstuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - For complete beginners to (Python) programming.
- [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh/) - Create and share beautiful images of your source code.


## Images +

Want to add your artwork to this archive? Email your images with (1) descriptions and (2) how your would like to be attributed to:

guild@shriker.ca

Depending on the number of images you have, you can either have your own page(s) and/or galleries for each of your characters.

I am also interested in collecting screenshots, writing samples (if you're comfortable), old guild layouts, old usernames and character names, banners, and other bits of graphic design. So if there isn't a category yet, we can create one.

## To This Site

The [source code](https://github.com/shriker/seizethenight) to this site is publically available for you to look at and contribute to. It is a static site that is being generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's hosted on GitHub for free.

## A Feature or Suggestion

Don't know how to contribute to the code directly? That's okay! You can still [create issues and feature requests](https://github.com/shriker/seizethenight/issues/new/choose) without having coding knowledge. ðŸŒ¼

## I wasn't a member, but...

If you were not a member of StN, you are still welcome and belong here. There is a pre-customization era creative guild clique that I am aiming this archive at that was far larger than StN. That said, previous membership is not a requirement. You can be a [member now](/join/).
