Welcome!

## Where to find us?

Looking to reconnect with people? Or new people? Here are a few haunts:

* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jBGsar4) - Quickest way to contact soulwolf (Shriker) [![Join us on Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/731930956570820711?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/jBGsar4)
* [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/seizethenightneopets) - (Private) You need to be approved to view posts, but it's got a bunch of artwork made ugly by Facebook's compression algorithm.
* [Neopets Guild](http://www.neopets.com/guilds/guild.phtml?id=171854) - Inactive and due to scheduled board wiping, not a great place to post.
