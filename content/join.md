Welcome!

## Where to find us?

Looking to reconnect with people? Or new people? Here are a few haunts:

* [Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#seizethenight:shadowlack.com) - *\#seizethenight:shadowlack.com* Quickest way to contact soulwolf (Shriker)
* [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/5awPT2s) - A mirror of the Matrix channel in Discord.
* [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/seizethenightneopets) - (Private) You need to be approved to view posts, but it's got a bunch of artwork made ugly by Facebook's compression algorithm.
* [Neopets Guild](http://www.neopets.com/guilds/guild.phtml?id=171854) - Inactive and due to scheduled board wiping, not a great place to post.
