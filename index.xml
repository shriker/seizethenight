      <description>This is a living archive for the [x] Seize the Night [x] (StN) guild from Neopets. Circa 2000~2005. The aim is to collect all of the excellent creations we made during the pre-customization era of Neopets (and beyond).
Seize the Night was originally a nameless collective on Neopets. In October of 2000, I (soulwolf) started creating threads with the title &amp;ldquo;[x] Lupe Role Play [x]&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;General Chat&amp;rdquo; neoboard. When Neopets introduced player-created guilds, there was enough interest that I created one.</description>

      <description>Looking to help out? Here is how.
Something New The greatest thing you can do to support the spirit of [x] StN [x] is to learn or create something new. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be code, even though many of us were deeply into HTML and CSS due to PetPages. It just has to be something. Bonus points if you can then teach this to someone else.
 See what resources are available at your local library.</description>

      <description>I mean&amp;hellip;
Welcome!
Where to find us? Looking to reconnect with people? Or new people? Here are a few haunts:
 Matrix Channel - #seizethenight:shadowlack.com Quickest way to contact soulwolf (Shriker) Discord Channel - A mirror of the Matrix channel in Discord. Facebook Group - (Private) You need to be approved to view posts, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a bunch of artwork made ugly by Facebook&amp;rsquo;s compression algorithm. Neopets Guild - Inactive and due to scheduled board wiping, not a great place to post.</description>
