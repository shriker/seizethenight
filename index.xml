      <description>This is a living archive for the [x] Seize the Night [x] (StN) guild from Neopets. Circa 2001.
Seize the Night (StN) was originally a nameless collective on Neopets. I (soulwolf) started creating threads with the title &amp;ldquo;[x] Lupe Role Play [x]&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;Evil Things and Monster Sightings&amp;rdquo; neoboard. (There was no Roleplay neoboard category.)
When Neopets introduced guilds, there was enough interest that I decided to create one. I picked the name &amp;ldquo;Seize the Night&amp;rdquo; based on the 1998 Dean Koontz novel of the same name.</description>

Where to find us? Looking to reconnect with people? Here are a few haunts:
 Discord Server - Quickest way to contact soulwolf (Shriker)  Facebook Group - (Private) You need to be approved to view posts, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a bunch of artwork made ugly by Facebook&amp;rsquo;s compression algorithm. Neopets Guild - Inactive and due to scheduled board wiping, not a great place to post.  Contributing Want to add your artwork to this archive?</description>
